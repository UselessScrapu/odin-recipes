        A long-simmered one-pot meal of corned beef cooked to perfection and served with tender cabbage, potatoes, and carrots would please any Irish-American on St. Patrick’s Day. Add some mustard or a creamy horseradish sauce, and you have a true celebration.

        Corned beef is most often a flat-cut brisket, but sometimes it’s made from beef round that has been cured with salt. Large grained rock salt, called “corns” of salt (one of several explanations why it’s called corned beef), was used when people began to preserve meat by salt-curing.
